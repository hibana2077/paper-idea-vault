## Experiment 1: Multimodal Feature Distillation for Incomplete Modalities

- **Objective:** Develop a Multimodal Feature Distillation module to effectively handle incomplete modalities during brain tumor segmentation.

- **Method:**
  - **Data Preparation:** Use a dataset with brain MRI images where some modalities are intentionally omitted to simulate incomplete modalities.
  - **Model Architecture:** Implement a feature distillation mechanism that can integrate available modalities and infer missing information.
  - **Training:** Train the model with complete and incomplete modal sets to learn the distillation of features from available modalities.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Segmentation Accuracy:** Measure the accuracy of tumor segmentation on images with missing modalities.
  - **Robustness:** Evaluate how the model performs with various combinations of missing modalities.
  - **Feature Representation Quality:** Use techniques like t-SNE to visualize the quality of feature representations learned from incomplete data.

## Experiment 2: CNN-Transformer Hybrid Network for Enhanced Semantic Modeling

- **Objective:** Utilize a CNN-Transformer hybrid network to improve the semantic modeling of the relationship between global and local information in brain tumor segmentation.
- **Method:**
  - **Data Preparation:** Utilize a comprehensive brain MRI dataset that includes multiple modalities.
  - **Model Architecture:** Develop a hybrid architecture that combines the locality-sensitive features of CNNs with the global receptive fields of Transformers.
  - **Training:** Train the model on the full dataset, focusing on enhancing its ability to integrate local and global information.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Segmentation Performance:** Compare the segmentation performance with traditional CNN and standalone Transformer models.
  - **Information Integration:** Assess how well the model integrates local details with global contextual information.
  - **Computational Efficiency:** Evaluate the modelâ€™s computational demand and inference time.

## Experiment 3: Cross-Modal Fusion for Global Correlation Alignment

- **Objective:** Design a Cross-Modal Fusion module that can explicitly align global correlations among different brain imaging modalities.
- **Method:**
  - **Data Preparation:** Use a dataset with diverse brain imaging modalities.
  - **Model Architecture:** Implement a fusion module that can process and integrate features from multiple modalities, aligning them based on their global correlations.
  - **Training:** Focus on optimizing the fusion process to maximize the coherence and complementarity of the modalities.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Fusion Effectiveness:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the fusion in improving the accuracy and robustness of segmentation.
  - **Alignment Quality:** Assess the quality of alignment of global features across modalities.
  - **Clinical Relevance:** Test the clinical relevance of the segmented outputs in real-world diagnostic scenarios.

Each of these experiments will require careful consideration of the dataset, preprocessing methods, and evaluation criteria to ensure that they align with the objectives and can effectively test the hypotheses.

A small tool that can help computer scientists, researchers, and students to brainstorm and further develop research ideas.

## Features

- A lightweight application based on Redis and FastAPI.
- Automatic literature search for relevant references.
- Assistance in formulating research questions, hypotheses, and objectives.
- Help with designing experimental goals and methods.
- Brainstorming further research topics.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: Redis
- **MISC**: Docker, Langchain

## Roadmap

- [X] Basic implementation of the application.
- [ ] Add ollama as a language model provider.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
